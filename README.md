# To run the code: 
* 1. Create a text file with the list of scheduled unavailable times, the times people clock in and clock out and the duration of the meeting
* 2. Put the text file within the same folder as the function file
* 3. Start the program and enter in the text file name using “.txt” at the end (You do not need an output file; the system will automatically make one for you called “Output.txt”)
* 4. Open “Output.txt” and there will be a list of times available for everyone
